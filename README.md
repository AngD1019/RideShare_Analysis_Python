# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
#### Summarizing, Visualizing, and Analyzing PyBer Data
In this assignment, I was tasked with creating a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type for the ride-sharing company called "PyBer". Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type. In this analysis, I will review the data I aggregated and showed in visualizations for this project, and analyze how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
#### Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types

The below image shows a breakdown of the significant data associated with each different city type: rural, suburban, and urban. In observing this image, we can see that there are several differences in Pyber usage and needs in these different types of environments. For Total Rides, we can see that, as one would expect, rural areas account for the fewest total rides and urban areas account for the most, with suburban areas landing in the middle-lower range. The number of PyBer drivers in these three different areas correlates directly to the number of total rides in these areas, with rural showing the fewest drivers, suburban in the middle, and urban with the highest number of drivers. This continues to correlate as we move from left to right on this table, when viewing the total fares amount that is brought in for each of these areas. The correlation seems to flip in the opposite direction when we look at average fare per ride and average fare per driver. These categories show that the rural area has the highest rate for fares per ride and per driver, and the urban areas having the lowest rate for fares per ride and per driver.

Below is a way to visualize total fare earned by city type when looking at a smaller subset of time, January 1, 2019 through April 29, 2019. In this chart we can see a similar trend and correlation to the above data, where the total fare in city settings is in the highest range, running as high as $2500. We can also see the inverse of this with the rural setting, where total fares run on the lower end, only as high as $500.

## Summary
#### Business recommendations based on above results

In advising the CEO, V. Isualize, I would make the following recommendations for PyBer moving forward. 
1. Given the above data, I would focus on how to increase the total fares being earned in rural areas. One way to do this would be to decrease fares being charged to riders in these areas. This will incentivize more riders to use the service. Fares cannot be brought too far down, but far enough so that it does not feel like a hardship or a big deal to catch a ride with PyBer rather than driving themselves or getting a friend to drive. 
2. Marketing in rural areas is my next recommendation. This marketing would have to target demographics who go out to bars, restaurants, or other events or errands in rural areas where they need to travel longer distances. I grew up in a very rural area and I can tell you from personal experience, it is generally more expensive to use ride share services like PyBer in these areas, which often means that people will use them less. However, in these areas, we often have longer rides to take to get to places, but there are often not many options (if any) for public transport. This can be especially challenging if you are out drinking alcohol at a bar or restaurant and then need to drive home after. In cities, people usually just take a ride share service like PyBer to get home. This could be another area that PyBer looks into, how to market to people who need rides to get around in rural areas.
3. Hiring more drivers in rural areas is my final recommendation. As I mentioned above, living in rural areas means you have to travel longer distances to do what you need to do and to get home. If there aren't enough drivers to meet the needs of people who are spread out, that means that even when someone wants to use PyBer in a rural area, they may have a harder time getting a driver. Hiring more drivers would be an expense, but I believe that it would allow PyBer's profits to increase after some time, since more customers could be using the service more often.
